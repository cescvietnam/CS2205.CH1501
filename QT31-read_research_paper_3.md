## Neural Turing machines [(link)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf)

### Problem, motivation
- Computer program generally uses 3 fundamental mechanism: elementary operations (e.g., arithmetric operations), logical flow control (branching) and external memory access.
- Machine learning neglected the use of logical flow control and external memory.
- RNN (recurrent neural network) is suitable to represent the logical flow control and external memory => End-to-end trainable (using gradient descent algorithm).
