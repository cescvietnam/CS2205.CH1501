## HSA-RNN: Hierarchical Structure-Adaptive RNN for Video Summarization

### Problem/motivation
- Video summarization: input long video, output short video with important portions kept.
- Video summarization is in the need because of huge amount of video created daily.
- Video has structure: they include several shots and each shot include several frame.
- Current techniques don't exploit this structure or don't do it properly (e.g., fixed length shot)
